# sz-sdk-json-type-definition

If you are beginning your journey with [Senzing],
please start with [Senzing Quick Start guides].

You are in the [Senzing Garage] where projects are "tinkered" on.
Although this GitHub repository may help you understand an approach to using Senzing,
it's not considered to be "production ready" and is not considered to be part of the Senzing product.
Heck, it may not even be appropriate for your application of Senzing!

## :warning: WARNING: sz-sdk-json-type-definition is still in development :warning: _

Although it can be reviewed and commented on,
the recommendation is not to use it yet.

## Synopsis

The Senzing sz-sdk-json-type-definition uses [JSON Type Definition]
to model the JSON that is returned from Senzing API calls.

## Overview

By using the code generated by [JSON Type Definition],
JSON returned by the Senzing API calls are easier to parse.
Examples:

1. Python - [main.py]
1. Go - [main.go]
1. Java - [main.java]
